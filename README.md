# Georgian WordLists

Collection of useful wordlists in Georgia (Country) which I have used in the past. To add various permutations to a password list, you can use a combination of command line tools that generate permutations and append them to the existing list. Some tools that might be useful to combine with these password lists are Crunch, CUPP, hashcat...


* firstnames_geo.txt --> Collection of Georgian First names
* lastnames_geo.txt --> Collection of Georgian last names
* geowordlist.txt --> General Collections of passwords in Georgia
* wifi_passlist_geo.txt --> Collection of WiFi passwords in Georgia
